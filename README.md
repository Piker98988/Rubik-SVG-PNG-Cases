# Rubik-SVG-PNG-Cases
In this repository I will be posting all of the possible cases for the rubik's cube for different methods such as M2, CFOP, ROUX, Winter variation...
All of these SVGs and PNGs can be reused with credits.
# UPDATE
Hello everyone, probably no one is reading this, but two days ago due to incompatibilities between window's and linux's filesystem I lost all of my files, so I will be inactive for some days and then I plan to create another repo with all of my code and everything, so I don't lose again all of my files. Thanks to everyone who at least took a look at my work or just even saw it, thanks.
